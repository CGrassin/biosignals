# BioSignals

**This project is work-in-progress.**

BioSignals is a multi-channel, up to 24-bits resolution acquisition system for bio-potentials (EMG, ECG, EEG and more). 

Repository structure:
* **Firmware_BioSignals**: the firmware to be programmed on the board with STM32duino.
* **Electronics_BioSignals**: the circuit board files.
* **Software_BioSignals**: software for the host computer
* **CAD_BioSignals**: 3D files (EEG headware).
* **Interface.md**: description of the data and command interface to the board.
